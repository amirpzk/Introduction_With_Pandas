# Introduction_With_Pandas

  In this code Jupyter file, I've done some great examples with Pandas, and if you want to start to work with Pandas, I think It would be great for you!

  **Pandas** is a package for data manipulation and analysis in Python. Pandas is derived the econometrics term *Panel Data*.
Panda incorporates two additional data structures into Python, namely **Panda Series** and **Panda DataFrame**.

In this code example, we are going to work with some of the most important features of Pandas, and you'll be able to use the basic methods.

You'll learn:
 * How to import Pandas.
 * How to create Pandas work with series in pandas.
 * How to access and change elements in Series and DataFrames
 * How to perform arithmatic operations on Series
 * How to load into a DataFrame
 * How to deal with Not a Number(NaN) values
